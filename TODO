 - Make nav bar at the top stick and the rest of the panel scroll as needed
 View source of view-source:http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy
 Need to refactor top-level nav bar so it's common and breadcrumbed
 Same for sensor sub-nav bar, so both can be pinned
 - Change the top-level page
    - Sprinkler control page
        - Set up recurring watering time
        - Adjust rain manipulation settings (details TBD)

How to do dynamic range behavior...
^sensor/#1/date1$ (date1 through now)
^sensor/#1/date1/date2$ (date1-date2)
^sensor/#1/#2/date1/date2$ Show both sensors 1 and 2 in the given range

    - Link to rainfall landing page
        - Show last 24 hours (can set the date to a specific date)
        - Show last week
        - Show last month
        - Show last year
        - Show year-to-date
    - Link to outside readings
        - Show last 24 hours (can set the date to a specific date)
        - Show last week
        - Show last month
        - Show last year
        - Show year-to-date
    - link to cellar readings
        - Show last 24 hours (can set the date to a specific date)
        - Show last week
        - Show last month
        - Show last year
        - Show year-to-date

    Left on the TODO list:
     * Wire it up to the back-end so it actually controls things
     * Figure out how to do background processing using the datamodel
     * Implement the history stuff
     * Implement scheduling, and try to make it resilient (cron?)
     * Make sure that we err on the side of turning sprinklers off in the
       face of errors so things don't wind up getting stuck on indefinitely
       due to software bugs
     * Better templates, branding, look and feel, etc.
