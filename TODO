 - Revamp to class based views

 - Make nav bar at the top stick and the rest of the panel scroll as needed
 View source of view-source:http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#scrollspy
 Need to refactor top-level nav bar so it's common and breadcrumbed
 Same for sensor sub-nav bar, so both can be pinned
 - Change the top-level page
    - Sprinkler control page
        - Set up recurring watering time
        - Adjust rain manipulation settings (details TBD)

How to do dynamic range behavior...
^sensor/#1/date1$ (date1 through now)
^sensor/#1/date1/date2$ (date1-date2)
^sensor/#1/#2/date1/date2$ Show both sensors 1 and 2 in the given range

    - Link to rainfall landing page
        - Show last 24 hours (can set the date to a specific date)
        - Show last week
        - Show last month
        - Show last year
        - Show year-to-date
    - Link to outside readings
        - Show last 24 hours (can set the date to a specific date)
        - Show last week
        - Show last month
        - Show last year
        - Show year-to-date
    - link to cellar readings
        - Show last 24 hours (can set the date to a specific date)
        - Show last week
        - Show last month
        - Show last year
        - Show year-to-date

    Left on the TODO list:
     * Rain Data consolidation
       - Drop new readings that are identical to the prior reading
     * Rain data "storm" identification, and summaries
       - Look over data and find contiguous 24 hour periods with rain, and
         summarize their totals over the duration - should be fast after
         doing the consolidation.
     * Look for other DB optimizations to try to speed things up more
     * Main entry page is still too slow on a pi - look at ways to speed it
       up... maybe a new data object that is a summary object that is replaced
       every time data is updated by the cronjob
     * Implement scheduling, and try to make it resilient (cron?)
     * Make sure that we err on the side of turning sprinklers off in the
       face of errors so things don't wind up getting stuck on indefinitely
       due to software bugs
     * Better templates, branding, look and feel, etc.
